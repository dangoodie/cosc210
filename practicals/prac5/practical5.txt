-- Relational algebra practical

1. Display customers with student account in Armidale branch
customer_acc := (customer JOIN ssn=cssn customer_account) ano=anum customer_account
student_acc := customer_acc WHERE atype='Student'
student_bank := student_acc JOIN (bco, bno) = (bco, bnum) bank_branch
armidale_student := student_bank WHERE b_address = 'Armidale'

2. Lets display average, total and count of balances per branch.
customer_acc := customer_acount JOIN ano=anum account
customer_bank := customer_acc JOIN (bco,bno) = (bco,bnum) bank_branch
balances_per_branch := AVERAGE, balance, SUM, balance, COUNT, balance (customer_bank) GROUP BY bnum
