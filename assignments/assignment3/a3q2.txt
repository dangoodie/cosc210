Identify functional dependencies
    - student_id -> first_name. last_name, date_of_birth
    - unit_code -> unit_name
    - degree -> school, degree_length

Define Keys
    - student_id
    - unit_code
    - degree
    - student_id, unit_code (composite key)


Normalise the schema
    Student Table
        - student_id (Primary Key)
        - first_name
        - last_name
        - date_of_birth
        - degree
    
    Unit Table
    	- unit_code (Primary Key)
    	- unit_name

    Degree Table
    	- degree (Primary Key)
    	- school
    	- degree_length
    	
    Enrollment Table
    	- student_id (Foreign Key)
    	- unit_code (Foreign Key)
    	
Every table has full dependence on the primary key making it compliant with 3NF.
The Enrollment table represent the relationship between a student and the units
they are enrolled in. This being a composite key ensures that they cannot be enrolled
in the same unit twice reducing redundancy and complying with 3NF.
