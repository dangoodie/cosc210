Database Schema: A, B, C, D, E
Functional Dependancies
	1. D -> CE
	2. A -> B
	3. B -> E
	4. C -> B
	
Decomposition
	R1 = {CAE}
	R2 = {DB}
	R3 = {ABD}
	
Step 1 + 2: 
	- Create an initial matrix of size attribute i by relations j
	- Place Bij in each empty cell
	
	    A   B   C   D   E
	R1  B11 B12 B13 B14 B15
	R2  B21 B22 B23 B24 B25
	R3  B31 B32 B33 B34 B35
	
Step 3:
	- Place Ai in each cell that corresponds to an attribute in the relation row
	
	    A   B   C   D   E
	R1  A1  B12 A3  B14 A5 
	R2  B21 A2  B23 A4  B25
	R3  A1  A2  B33 A4  B35
	
Step 4:
	- For all key attributes per row:
		- Find cells in row containing key X with bij
		- Place Ai in each cell associated with Y, if the FD exists in another row
		- Repeat for all dependancies
		
	    A   B   C   D   E
	R1  A1  A2  A3  B14 A5 
	R2  B21 A2  B23 A4  A5
	R3  A1  A2  B33 A4  A5 
	
Step 5:
	- If a row contains all Ai then the decomposition is lossless
	This decomposition does not satisfy the requirements to be lossless as no row contains all R3 values. In particular, the relation D -> CE is not preserved in any rows.
